## Project
UK Road Accident Analysis for 2021-2022

## Problem Statement
The primary concern is to identify key pattern and trends that can inform policy decisions aimed at reducing accidents. Specifically, i would like to know which times of day, weather conditions, and locations are most associated with severe accidents. Additionally, I am intereated in understanding how factors like the type of road e.g. motorways vs urban roads and the involvement of certain vehicle types e.g. motorcycles or heavy goods vehicles impact accident severity.

The goal is to use this analysis to develop targetted interventions, such as traffic control measures, public awareness campaigns, or infrastructure improvements, that can help reduce the occurrence and severity of road accidents in the most affected areas. This analysis will help us to derive actionable insights from the dataset and ultimately improve road safety in the UK.
